########## ELMA 0.1 Installation Guide ##########

1.1 REQUIREMENTS

The requirements are based on the current Debian GNU/Linux stable branch also known as "Etch". 
ELMA has been developed and test on that distribution. If you have successfully installed and 
run it on any other distributions plaese send a short mail and this list will be completed.

1.1.1 Debian Etch

        * Apache 2.2.3
        * PHP 4.4.4 
        * OpenLDAP 2.3.30
        * Smarty 2.6.14
        * Smarty-Gettext 1.0b1 


1.2 PREPARATIONS

1.2.1 LDAP Server

ELMA has been testet only to work with OpenLDAP Server.

Install and set up your ldap server as described in your distriubution's manual. 
There is an example openldap slapd.conf in the ldap subdirectory.
Start with an empty LDAP tree and run

   # slapadd -l examples/ldap/example.ldif

from within the directory where this INSTALL file is located. This will create an admin user 
with the dn "uid=admin,ou=users,o=mybasedn" and the password "admin".

1.2 INSTALLATION

Copy the downloaded tarball to your webserver's document root directory (e.g. /var/www). 
 
   # cp elma-0.1.tar.gz /var/www

Extract the tarball in your webserver's document root directory.

   # tar -xzvf elma-0.1.tar.gz

Create the smart's template cache directory called "template_c" and make it writable for you 
webserver's user (e.g www-data)

   # mkdir /var/www/templates_c/
   # chown www-data:www-data /var/www/templates_c/
   # chmod 775 /var/www/templates_c/

Now you should be able to log in to ELAM via a webbrowser using the user "admin" with password "admin".
To change the admin's user password you have to use the ldap tools of you distribution or usw something 
similar like "phpLdapAdmin" or "gq".
